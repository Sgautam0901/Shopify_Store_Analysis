## Overview
In this project, the objective was to boost subscription revenue and minimize customer churn for a supplement ecommerce Shopify store. The scope of work involved several tasks to achieve this goal:

Customer Segmentation: The customer list was divided into three categories: one-time purchasers, occasional purchasers, and subscribers, to better understand their behavior and preferences.

Dashboard Creation: An interactive dashboard was developed, showcasing key metrics such as total revenue, subscription revenue, monthly churn rate, subscriber count, and revenue breakdown by product for one-time and subscription purchases.

Product Subscription Analysis: The analysis identified products with the highest and lowest subscription rates, as well as those generating the highest and lowest lifetime revenue. This information helped uncover patterns and trends that could improve subscription rates for other products.

Churn Reason Analysis: Customers' reasons for canceling their subscriptions were analyzed. Common issues leading to churn were identified, such as perceived high prices or having excess product. These insights provided an opportunity to address these concerns and reduce churn.


Additional Insights: The analysis provided the freedom to add supplementary insights and interpretations to further improve subscription revenue and reduce churn. These additional insights tailored the approach and recommendations to the specific needs of the ecommerce store.

The project utilized various statistical analysis tools such as Python, R, SQL, or Excel, and the dashboard was created using Excel or Google Data Studio. A detailed report of findings and insights was prepared, along with a clear and concise presentation to the team.

By implementing the recommended actions derived from the insights, such as adjusting product pricing, addressing customer concerns, and refining subscription strategies, the supplement ecommerce store can effectively enhance subscription revenue and reduce customer churn.
